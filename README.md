# Time-Series Modeling of Physical Simulation Data

> This project focuses on modeling and forecasting time-dependent trajectories generated by physical simulations. The goal is to analyze noisy, high-dimensional time series representing physical systems and learn their temporal dynamics using machine learning approaches.
